0.1.1
improve loss function
learn about optimizers, and then non differentiable loss f'ns
for now - sign wrong weight 1.5, correct 0.5 
maybe decrease the #inc/#cor factor lower bound, down 0.1 or so maybe

0.1.2
model output
check if train and test losses are actually correct - how are test losses lower?

0.1.3
proper testing methodologies
test last 1/3/6 months for {ROI, % sign correct, ...}

0.1.4
lr_scheduler, hidden_size, lstm layers

0.1.5
model save/load

0.2.0
multivariate input

...

post backtesting, implemention of loss threshold, fee per trade, fill found checking
