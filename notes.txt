make a portfolio of stocks

within 1 etf?
	how similar are they if so
just a few?
etf?


train on only past 1 year of data? or how long? How long before not representative?
can train consecutively, or must be simultaneously? i.e. can input 1 stock after the other, or must be all at once?

should each iteration train on the same data? or should there be stocks that swap in / out ? 
	could keep same
	could randomly choose a subset of portfolio
	could randomly swap out X stocks 
	


model needs to somehow have memory of previous stuff
either that or input needs to be past X time of ---

reduced: 
outputs buy, sell if have, short, buy if have short


INPUTS:


cur bids + offers
for each:
127 + 1 remaining weighted avg
127 of the bids closest to cur price,
1 of weighted avg of all remaining offers/bids

successful transactions

cur holdings

volatility?

volume?

+ relevant metadata

OUTPUTS:
buy sell do nothing
amt


Evaluate upon:
profit
consistency
	can choose to penalise negative results more heavily -> incentivise more reliability
	want: penalise big discrepancy + wrong side heavy, but right sign less
		cur idea: weight the square errors
	
	
	
	
do weekends have an impact?
do long weekensd make less good?





I DONT THINK MY DATA INPUT MAKES ANY SENSE. 
NEED TO GIVE {yest_close->today_open, yest_open->today_close, yest_vol}
is that what i have?
